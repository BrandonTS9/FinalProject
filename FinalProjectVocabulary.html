	<td>List</td>
	<td>Has a fixed order, but new elements can be added.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Array</td>
	<td>Fixed number of elements, but the elements can switch places.</td>

	<td>Linear Search</td>
	<td>A search algorithm that searches a data set in a straight line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Adding in Binary</td>
	<td>Step 1: Line up the numbers.<br>Step 2: Calculate the new number knowing that 1 + 0 = 1, 0 + 0 = 0, and 1 + 1 = 0. Start from the right and head left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Processing Time</td>
	<td>The amount of time that it takes for an algorithm to complete all of its steps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Binary Search</td>
	<td>A search algorithm that selects the middle number in an ordered data set and eliminates half the list depending on whether the target number is less than or greater than the middle number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Bubble Sort</td>
	<td>Goes through a list as many times as necessary, swapping each pair of elements in the incorrect order. The largest element is guaranteed to be ordered at the end of the first pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Merge Sort</td>
	<td>This is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm. First, the data set is divided into two seperate lists until there are only groups of two or one elements. Then, these groups are sorted and placed back together as a whole data set. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Selection Sort</td>
	<td>Each pass, the lowest element is selected and moved to one side of the list. This is repeated until the data set is sorted.</td>

<tr>
	<td>Quick Sort</td>
	<td>This is also a divide and conquer sorting algorithm. First, a random pivot element is chosen. Second, the rest of the elements in the data set are moved to the left of to the right of the pivot according to their value.

</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Greedy Algorithm</td>
